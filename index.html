				Reynoso came into office with improved maternal healthcare on his agenda. He allocated 2023’s capital budget entirely to the cause – renovating NICUs and redesigning labor-and-delivery rooms at Brooklyn public hospitals. He also put money towards resources for neighborhoods with the worst maternal health outcomes, including a public education campaign and postpartum resource distribution. 
			</p>
			<p>Reynoso plans to continue: 
</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Investing in maternal health infrastructure in more Brooklyn public hospitals</li>
				<li>Expanding his Community Baby Shower Fund, which provides families in high-risk neighborhoods with resources and support for pregnancy and postpartum care</li>
				<li>Supporting the Maternal Health Taskforce, a group of eight Black women OBGYNs who Reynoso assembled to work on community-based solutions to the racial disparities in maternal morbidity rates</li>
